      <h3>Who We Are</h3>
      <br><p style="padding:0px">We’re a small startup based in Hawaii, established in 2020. Our name, Choke Change, has multiple meanings. Choke means what most of us know it as, but it also means “a lot” in Pidgin. The word "change" can mean making a difference, or it could refer to money. So, you could say that we want to earn “choke change” to bring “choke change” through selling our merch and donating.</p>

            <h4>Goal 1: Affordable Housing</h4>
            <p>
            Hawaii is well-known for having the highest living costs in the U.S., and because of this, many of the residents struggle to afford housing.<br/><br/>
            Our business aims to fundraise enough to purchase Hawaiian land and create a niche housing design that not only blends with the land but is also relatively affordable.

            +  "As we support and partner with these businesses, we can treat housing as a temporary incubator for them. As they become profitable, they can give back through donations or other help to support other entrepreneurs and business owners. After gaining sustainable momentum, we can start a program for successful small businesses to sponsor families needing affordable housing. And when that works out we can consider tackling general low income housing and possibly homeless. The key is to get some sustainable traction first with small businesses who help drive the Hawai’i economy.</p>"
    var goal3 = "<h4>Goal 3: Modernization of Pidgin</h4>"
            +"<p>=Pidgin is deeply rooted in Hawaiian history. It emerged in Hawaii’s sugar cane plantations in the mid to late 1800s. It’s said that it started as a way for plantation workers to communicate with each other because of their diverse languages (including Hawaiian, Japanese, Cantonese, Portuguese, and English). <br/><br/>"
            + "We’re creating HIbridgin as a modern form of Pidgin. HIbridgin will be a mix of Pidgin, English, and other forms of communication used today, such as emojis and abbreviations.<br/><br/>"
            + "We hope to encourage people to learn more about Pidgin and it’s rich and controversial history by including Pidgin and HIbridgin taglines on our merchandise.</p>"
