    <p>We’re hoping to address small businesses and entrepreneurs who are helping Hawaii’s economy and have the difficult task of making ends meet at home and running a business.
    <br/><br/>As we support and partner with these businesses, we can treat housing as a temporary incubator for them. As they become profitable, they can give back through donations or other help to support other entrepreneurs and business owners. After gaining sustainable momentum, we can start a program for successful small businesses to sponsor families needing affordable housing. And when that works out we can consider tackling general low income housing and possibly homeless. The key is to get some sustainable traction first with small businesses who help drive the Hawaiian economy.
