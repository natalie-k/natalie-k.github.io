  <div class="explanation">
    <p>Pidgin is deeply rooted in Hawaiian history. It emerged in Hawaii’s sugar cane plantations in the mid to late 1800s. According to historians, it started as a way for plantation workers to communicate with each other because of their diverse languages (including Hawaiian, Japanese, Cantonese, Portuguese, and English). However, because it shares components of different languages and does not always follow the same grammatical structure of English, many English speakers shun Pidgin and see it as "broken English," though that just isn't true.
      <br/><br/>We hope to encourage people to learn more about Pidgin and its rich and controversial history&#8212;and through this process get rid of the stigma surrounding it&#8212;by including Pidgin and HIbridgin* taglines on our merchandise.
      <br/><br/><br/>*HIbridgin is a modern form of Pidgin we're creating. HIbridgin will be a mix of Pidgin, English, and other forms of communication used today, such as emojis and abbreviations.
